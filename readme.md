# react-amp-layout
The [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)
[layout system](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md)
ported to React.js as a couple of easy to use functional stateless components.


## Installation
```shell
npm install --save react-amp-layout
```

## Usage
Either require the default exported component `Layout`:
```javascript
import Layout from 'react-amp-layout';
```
or import the specific layout component you're interested in:
```javascript
import {FixedHeight} from 'react-amp-layout';
```

## <3
The idea for this component is heavily inspired by the work of the awesome people working
on the AMP Project who have figured out the layout system and documented it.
